# Data Science Coursera
Well this is a regular guys attempt to learn Data Science and attain some level of expertise in it.
All i would be doing in this repository is : -

- Keep a record of all the courses I undertake and all what I do in exploring the subject.

- I will do the programs in R programming Language and upload all the studies I make

- I will try to enlist links of all important sources I can get

- I will upload the relevant Certifications I get

Lets see how long it takes to gain some reasonable expertise from being a complete noob :p
